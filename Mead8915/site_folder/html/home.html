      <p>Hello! My name is Olive Meadows! My legal name is Olivia, but I've
        never liked that name so I changed it to Olive! I go by She/They
        pronouns. </p>
      <p> I absolutely love animals of any shape or size! Currently, my family
        and I only own one cat and one dog. Our cat's name is Zora; She's not
        the most friendly cat, but she can be loving when she wants to be! Our
        dog's name is Vlady, short for Vladimir. He's a German-Husky mix and
        weighs over 100 pounds! He's a real cutie with a love for other animals
        and rubber balls! My mother and I also really like to foster puppies and
        kitties through <a href="https://www.paws.org/wildlife/">PAWS</a>
        foster program! It's through their program that we met Vlad when he was
        only three weeks old! </p>
      <table class="Home Table" style="width: 100%;">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Zora</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Vlady</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Vlady &amp; Foster</strong></td>

      <p> I love to spend some of my free time baking! I don't do it too often
        to spare my family the urge to eat all of it. I specialize in sweets,
        like cookies, cakes, and cupcakes. I've taken an icing piping class and
        a chocolate melting class! </p>
      <p> I made these cupcakes for my older sister's baby shower! </p>
      <img src="../images/cupcakes.png" alt="Cupcakes" id="cupcakes" width="521">
      <br>
      <br>
      <p> When I'm not baking or doing school work, I'm almost always playing
        video games! My favorite genres of video games are fantasy, RPG, action,
        and adventure. My current favorite video games are all three games of
        the Dragon Age series and The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. I enjoy games where
        you can create your own character and become someone important. I favor
        easier games rather than hard games because I have a lot more fun being
        able to run around without too much trouble rather than being killed
        instantly by anything that touches me. </p>
