	<p> I really enjoyed the CIS 241 Web Dev class. I've taken a Visual Basic coding class before and did okay in it, but I have to say I like HTML coding better. My favorite part of HTML coding is probably the designing part of creating Websites. I like the ability to change the background of my website, the navigation buttons, and more. It's not really suprising to me that I enjoyed this class as I think of myself as having a logical mind, meaning I like things that follow a logical path, like math. 2+2 is always equal to 4. There's no "but"s or "if"s about it. That's what I like about math and coding. It makes sense.</p>
	<br/>
	
	<p> I'm not the best at coming up with my own designs for anything, including webpages. However, I've still managed to have fun editing the webpages given to the class through the labs and creating my own webpage here! I think if I did continue down the web development path, turning it into a career, I think I'd want to focus on developing a website with a set design made by a design team, rather than developing the design myself.</p>
	<br/>
	
	<p> Web development is a very big industry due to the ever growing popularity of the internet and the webpages hosted on it. So I think I'd be hard to struggle to find some company looking for web developers. This is definitely a career path I will consider in the future! I'm already registered to take the next Web Development class in the winter quarter!</p>
